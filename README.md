## Instructions
- Get serial of Azeron device (`lsusb -d 16d0: -v | grep iSerial`)
- `noreza --serial <SERIAL>`
    - If your device does not have a serial or it shows as 0, you can pass the product id instead `noreza --product-id 0x12f7`
    - It is the 2nd segment of lsusb, e.g. `16d0:12f7`
- You can pass `--wait` to have the program wait for a matching device to be connected
- Access the web interface at localhost:1337 (port can be changed with `--port`)


## Tips:
- A udev rule might be useful to start the process on device connect (process stops if device disconnects)
